# hook

- use state and other React features without writing a class
- hooks are functions that let you 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features from function components
- hook不会给dom树中添加额外的节点
  - hook可以讲生命周期中的逻辑整合到一起，但是event无法整合



## rules

- call at the top level
- call from React function components
