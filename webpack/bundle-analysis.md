# Bundle Analysis

Once you start splitting your code, it can be useful to analyze the output to check where modules have ended up. The [official analyze tool](https://github.com/webpack/analyse) is a good place to start. There are some other community-supported options out there as well:

- [webpack-chart](https://alexkuz.github.io/webpack-chart/): Interactive pie chart for webpack stats.
- [webpack-visualizer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/): Visualize and analyze your bundles to see which modules are taking up space and which might be duplicates.
- [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer): A plugin and CLI utility that represents bundle content as a convenient interactive zoomable treemap.
- [webpack bundle optimize helper](https://webpack.jakoblind.no/optimize): This tool will analyze your bundle and give you actionable suggestions on what to improve to reduce your bundle size.
- [bundle-stats](https://github.com/bundle-stats/bundle-stats): Generate a bundle report(bundle size, assets, modules) and compare the results between different builds.
